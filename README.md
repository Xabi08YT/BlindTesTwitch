# BlindTesTwitch

A **Blind-Test** web-application written in React, using Spotify/Twitch APIs

You're a streamer and you want to use the app ?   
The application is deployed and ready to use !   
Just contact me on Discord (**neumann__**) so I can whitelist you ðŸ˜Š

## Description

TL;DR; Log in your Spotify and Twitch accounts, chose your playlist in the list, start the game with your viewers.

BlindTesTwitch is a all-in-one webapp: it controls your Spotify to launch the tracks, it displays the leaderboard and it reads your twitch chat to check the answers and give points to the fastest players.

- Live leaderboard
- Typo tolerance
- Playlist edition (remove tracks, edit/hide/add any values to guess)
